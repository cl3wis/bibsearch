.SH "NAME"
\fBbibsearch\fR \- BibTeX database management tool
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbibsearch\fR [\fIglobal options\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fIcommand options\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The process of searching for BibTeX entries is cumbersome and annoying\. Authors are inconsistent in providing them, and they are optional on the arXiv\. Google Scholar is useful, but yielding BibTeX entries requires drilling down into entries\. What\'s worse, for some research fields (such as citations from the ACL Anthology), the correct citations are not the first search result\. And anyway, why should you have to open a web browser to do something that is inherently text\-based? Ideally one should have to do these tasks only once per paper, but the reality is that management of a database introduces another set of problems\.
.
.P
If this problem statement strikes a chord, \fBbibsearch\fR is the tool for you\. It provides the following services:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Keyword\-based search against a private collection of entries (\fBbibsearch search\fR)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Automatic downloading of citations from predefined collections (\fBbibsearch add bib://\fR) or arbitrary URI\'s (\fBbibsearch add\fR)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Searching and downloading from the arXiv (\fBbibsearch arxiv\fR)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Automatic generation of a project BibTeX file from LaTeX source (\fBbibsearch tex\fR)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Keyword\-based downloading and opening of PDF files (\fBbibsearch open\fR)

.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR
Specify the config file used by \fBbibsearch\fR\. The options accepted in the config file are listed in the \fICONFIG FILE\fR section\.
.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show \fBbibsearch\fR version\.
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show a short help message\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
Bibsearch operation is guided by commands\. Each command accepts the \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR option to list additional options\.
.
.TP
\fBadd\fR \fIfiles or URLs or bibspecs\fR
Adds entries to the BibTeX database\. Three types of inputs are supported: \fIfiles\fR, \fIURLs\fR and \fIbibspecs\fR\. \fIfiles\fR are local files present in the filesystem\. \fIURLs\fR are http addresses\. The file will be downloaded and added to the database\. \fIbibspecs\fR have the form \fBbib://<spec>\fR, e\.g\. \fBbib://acl\fR\. These are known resources for \fBbibsearch\fR which will be updated as new conferences are held\. The list of know resources can be listed with the special \fBbib://list\fR specification\. For some of these resources, finer grain specification is available, e\.g\. you can specify \fBbib://acl/emnlp\fR for only adding the EMNLP conference\. \fBbibsearch\fR stores which URLs have already been downloaded, and by default does not re\-download them again\. In this way you can update your database efficiently by giving a bibspec resource, \fBbibsearch\fR will only download the new entries\. If you still want to re\-download known files, use the \fB\-r\fR flag\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR [\fIquery\fR]
Searches the database\. For the syntax of search queries look at the [SEARCH QUERIES][] section\. By default the search results are listed in a human\-readable format\. Use the \fB\-b\fR option to show them in BibTeX format\.
.
.TP
\fBarxiv\fR [\fIquery\fR]
TODO
.
.TP
\fBopen\fR [\fIquery\fR]
Opens the corresponding paper if the \fIquery\fR returns only one result\. Requires the BibTeX entry to specify an \fIURL\fR field\. See the [SEARCH QUERIES][] section for the syntax of the \fIquery\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBtex\fR \fIfile\fR
Generates the BibTeX file corresponding to a \.tex file\. The information is read from the \.aux file, i\.e\. LaTeX needs to have been run at least once\. By default the BibTeX entries are printed to stdout\. With the \fB\-b\fR option the bib file specified in the \.tex file is generated, although it will not be overwritten if it already exists\. Use \fB\-B\fR if you want to overwrite the file\.
.
.TP
\fBedit\fR [\fIquery\fR]
Opens an external editor to edit the BibTeX entries returned by the \fIquery\fR\. Please do not modify the \fBoriginal_key\fR field, as this is used internally by \fBbibsearch\fR to identify the entries\.
.
.TP
\fBremove\fR [\fIquery\fR]
Removes the entries returned by \fIquery\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBmacros\fR
Lists the macros known by bibsearch that can be used in search queries\.
.
.TP
\fBman\fR
Shows this man page\.
